=== 1.0.7.1 === 2023122801

    version and saved it as monologo7 in my working folders.

    broken. Reverted to old version of agax.php and it is back to working.
20231228 iContent_1145bt - The slide setting, Expand question area, does not work. Opened
    ticket is not needed. Did not work as there were no questions on a slide.
20231228 iContent_1146bt - pix_url is deprecated. Use image_url for images and pix_icon
    for icons. Made the change to image_url.
20231228 iContent_1147bt - The addquestionpage.php needs rewrite to handle the volumn
    of questions on this site. Started dev. As of 20240107 and iContent_1157 and
    iContent_1158, the addquestion page.php works much better.
20231229 iContent_1148bt - Most of the event files need the, protected function
    get_legacy_logdata(), removed. Removed the functions and rearranged most of
    others in all of the event files.
20231230 iContent_1149bt - The file for iContent, settings.php, is missing. Created
    the missing file, then added settings for, Recent activities and Date format.
20240105 iContent_1157bt - When viewing questions, the page count is wrong. I have added
    code to the, function icontent_count_questions_of_questionbank($coursecontext) {,
    that limits the function to only counting questions in the course. Page count now
    appears to be correct and seems work correctly.
20240105 iContent_1158bt - Additional category with questions causes error, found more
    than one record, error. For error 2, I added code to fix the get_record_sql. For

    Changed and added standard Add and Cancel buttons. See ticket for details.
20240204 iContent_1186bt - Manual review (essay) gives error, String [grade,core] is
    deprecated. The code at toevaluate.php line 100 was pointing to Moodles old string
    for grade. Since iContent does have a grade string, I changed the code to point to
    it, and I also changed the string identifier to gradenoun. I then changed the code
    in the line 100 to use it.
20240204 iContent_1187bt - Manual review, after giving rating and saving - Exception...
    In the, icontent/classes/event/question_toevluate_created.php file, I removed the
    two occurances where stdClass was bing used. Manually rating an essay now seems
    to work without any problems.
20240204 iContent_1188bt - Text area is too small for essay question answer. Changed the
    class from span12 to col-12 and also added a place holder of, Write essay.
20240204 iContent_1190bt - For consistency, the tab for Question should be plural like the
    one for Notes. Changed string to plural - $string['doubt'] = 'Questions {$a}';.

    details. Think I have a little more to do on this.
20240205 iContent_1194bt - Colors and background images do NOT work on old or new pages.
    For colors, I was just doing them wrong by using # in front of the hex number. The
    background images problem was caused by switching from, or, over to using, ||, but
    without isolation the two items with their own parenthesis.
20240208 iContent_1200bt - mdl_icontent... is hardcoded in locallib.php and maybe other
